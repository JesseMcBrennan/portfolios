### What was your biggest achievement of the module?

My biggest achievement this module was securing an offer. 

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

Balance the requirements of the module with the job search. Trying to prioritize job related tasks with projects. 

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I think the network I did prior to the module starting, along with the continued follow up as the mod went on presented me a lot of opportunities that peers did not have. I took cold outreach very seriously.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

Getting to know the backend technologies rounded out my understanding of how applications are built. There were quite a few gaps in my understanding prior to working on the cross pollenization project.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

In addition to the technical skills I have developed, I think the biggest thing I have learned is how to work with others in a positive, collaborative way, even when there are difficulties.
